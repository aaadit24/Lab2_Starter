    <b>Meeting Agenda</b>
    <p>During the meeting, there are three main topics to be discussed. The first topic is icebreakers, which will allow everyone to get to know each other better.

The group will discuss and agree on a regular meeting schedule that works for everyone, as well as set a tentative date and time for the next meeting. The third topic is group name and branding. The group will brainstorm potential names and branding options, such as a logo or tagline. They will then decide on a name and branding direction that best represents the group's goals and values. Finally, the group will summarize the decisions made during the meeting, assign action items, and set a deadline for completing them before adjourning the meeting.</p>
